## 🎯 Learning Goals

Here is a list of projects I'm planning to build to deepen my understanding of Rust and its ecosystem, from low-level systems to high-level applications. Click on each project to learn more!

---

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Mini Database Engine with B-Tree</strong></summary>

*   **Description:** Build a simple, embedded database engine from scratch. It will support basic `CREATE`, `INSERT`, and `SELECT` operations, using a B-Tree index on disk for efficient data storage and retrieval.
*   **Key Concepts:** B-Tree data structure, file I/O, serialization, memory management, query parsing.
*   **Why it's a good project:** It's a challenging but incredibly rewarding project that demonstrates a deep mastery of data structures, performance, and systems programming in Rust.

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Solana Program (Smart Contract)</strong></summary>

*   **Description:** Develop and deploy a simple program on the Solana blockchain. For example, a decentralized voting system or a simple token minting dApp, and build a basic client to interact with it.
*   **Key Concepts:** Solana SDK, Anchor framework, on-chain program logic, client-side interaction, cryptography.
*   **Why it's a good project:** This project dives into the world of Web3, showing you can apply Rust's performance and safety to the exciting field of decentralized finance and applications.

<details>
<summary><strong>3. Safe Wrapper for a C Library (FFI)</strong></summary>

*   **Description:** Create a safe, idiomatic Rust wrapper ("crate") for an existing C library, such as `sqlite3` or a common compression library. The goal is to expose the C functionality through a safe Rust API.
*   **Key Concepts:** Foreign Function Interface (FFI), `unsafe` Rust, manual memory management, building safe abstractions.
*   **Why it's a good project:** It's an advanced project that proves you understand how Rust interacts with other ecosystems and how to build safe bridges to potentially unsafe code, a highly valuable skill.

<details>
<summary><strong>4. Mini Redis Engine</strong></summary>

*   **Description:** Implement a simplified, in-memory key-value store inspired by Redis. It should support basic commands like `SET`, `GET`, `DEL`, and handle multiple concurrent clients over TCP.
*   **Key Concepts:** TCP networking, command parsing, concurrent client handling, data structures (HashMap), persistence (optional).
*   **Why it's a good project:** It's a classic systems programming challenge that combines networking, concurrency, and data management, resulting in a practical and impressive tool.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>5. GPUI Application</strong></summary>

*   **Description:** Build a performant, cross-platform desktop application using the GPUI library. A great example would be a real-time Markdown editor with a live preview pane.
*   **Key Concepts:** Reactive UI, state management, high-performance rendering, layout management.
*   **Why it's a good project:** This positions you as a developer experimenting with cutting-edge UI technology, showcasing your ability to build fast and responsive user interfaces.

---

<details>
<summary><strong>6. Mini Spring Boot in Rust</strong></summary>

*   **Description:** Create a minimal web framework inspired by Spring Boot. It should feature a declarative routing system (using macros or attributes), basic middleware support, and perhaps a simple dependency injection mechanism.
*   **Key Concepts:** Procedural macros, traits, HTTP server implementation, routing logic, design patterns.
*   **Why it's a good project:** This goes beyond using a framework and teaches you how to build one. It demonstrates a deep understanding of Rust's metaprogramming capabilities and software architecture.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>7. Mini AI Agent</strong></summary>

*   **Description:** Develop a command-line AI agent that can perform tasks. It could use a local LLM (via Ollama) or an API (like OpenAI) to summarize files, generate boilerplate code, or answer questions about a codebase.
*   **Key Concepts:** HTTP client, JSON parsing, process management, prompt engineering, CLI tool development.
*   **Why it's a good project:** This project is highly relevant and modern. It shows you can integrate powerful AI models into practical tools, automating workflows and demonstrating creativity.
